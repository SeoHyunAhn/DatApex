Loosely translated, this means that a Naïve\n                    Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular\n                    feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other\n                    feature. This model is particularly useful for large data\n                    sets – along with simplicity, Naïve Bayes is known to\n                    outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods\n                    in some cases. <br></br>The Naïve Bayes algorithm works by\n                    converting the dataset into a frequency table, creating a\n                    likelihood table by calculating probabilities & then using\n                    the Naïve Bayes equation to calculate the posterior\n                    probability for each class. The class with the highest\n                    posterior probability is considered the outcome of the\n                    prediction. This algorithm is typically used in text\n                    classification & with problems having multiple classes.\n                  </p>\n\n                  <Link route=\"mlalgo\" params={{ path: \"nba\" }}>\n                    <a className=\"btn btn-primary\">Go somewhere</a>\n                  </Link>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"col-6\">\n              <div className=\"card\" style={styleCard}>\n                <div className=\"card-header\">Logistic Regression algorithm</div>\n                <div className=\"card-body\">\n                  <img\n                    className=\"card-img\"\n                    variant=\"top\"\n                    src=\"../static/lra.png\"\n                  />\n                  <h5 className=\"card-title\">Explanation: </h5>\n                  <p className=\"card-text\">\n                    Logistic Regression is a classification machine-learning\n                    algorithm used to assign observations to a discrete set of\n                    classes (binary or multiple classes).
